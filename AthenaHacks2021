For the AthenaHacks Hackathon in 2021, my team and I made DisneyAdventures:

What it does
Disney Adventures is an application that allows you to make your own adventures in the Disney Universe. From Tangled to Marvel, you can explore, interact, and allow your imagination to run wild through our visual-novel-styled storytelling platform. Users are given the opportunity to make decisions within each of the novels. The decisions change how the story ends and are reflected in traits portrayed at the conclusion of each story.


How we built it

    AppSmith, the base of the application, interface design and flow of the applicationâ€™s experience using Javascript, HTML, and CSS
    CockroachDB, a SQL database management system, to store all of the information about our users and keep track of all their encouraging messages!
    Adobe Photoshop and Canva for the graphic design and logo creation

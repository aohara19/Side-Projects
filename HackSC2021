For the 2021 HackSC Hackathon, my team and I built Bucket of Care.

What it does
Bucket of Care is an application that allows users to send kind, anonymous messages to each other. When users first come on the site, they will be greeted with a welcome screen that will enable them to add their name to the pool of possible recipients. From there, theyâ€™ll be able to switch between two other pages: Send a Message and Receive Messages. As the names imply, these pages allow users to send messages to recipients in the pool and access messages sent to them by their peers.

How we built it

    AppSmith, the base of the application, interface design and flow of the application,
    CockroachDB, a SQL database management system, to store all of the information about our users and keep track of all their encouraging messages!
    Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management service to send and receive messages which include images
    Adobe Photoshop and Canva for the logo design and animation
